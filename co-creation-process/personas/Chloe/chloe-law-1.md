# Chloe

Chloe is a lawyer who specialises in technology law and human rights.

## Goal
Chloe’s main goal is to create a report to identify gaps in existing UK legislation and provide recommendations for legal reforms. 

## Scenario
Chloe has been commissioned to produce a comprehensive report on legislation tackling gender-specific online harms, in particular those affecting women and girls.
Chloe’s work covers extensive legal documentation. The initial findings highlight that while the current legal framework addresses some forms of online abuse, a lack of specific definitions might not capture the whole range of harms victims experience, making it difficult to prosecute offenders and provide adequate protection and remedies to victims. For instance, a woman’s partner controls her social media accounts and uses tracking apps to control her every move. While some laws address domestic abuse, they often don’t account for how technology is used as a tool of abuse.
In her report, Chloe wants to identify online harms that are covered by current legislation, potentially complementing her research with online harms that are not (yet to be) considered. She would also like to describe the conditions under which an online harm constitutes an offence. Chole will find it useful to intersect her findings with information about technological mechanisms that facilitate or exacerbate online harms against women and girls, so it can encourage the development of safe online platforms.


## Competency Questions (CQs)
- To what extent can the current legal framework capture the range of online harms victims experience?
- What are the technical regulations applicable to online harms? 
- What technological tools/developments facilitate these harms?
