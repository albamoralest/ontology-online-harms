# Finn

## Goal
Finn is supporting a law enforcement agency by analysing data related to online harms, with the aim of identifying patterns, trends, and relationships over the past five years. He is particularly focused on online violence against women and girls (VAWG), and wants to generate insights to inform prevention strategies and operational responses.

## Scenario
Finn is collecting and analysing data on digital harms to support policing priorities around safeguarding and serious violence. He has access to various heterogeneous data sources—including police crime recording systems, open-source data, and records from third-sector organisations. He wants to categorise incidents by type of harm, platform used, tactics deployed, and affected groups, especially women, girls, and other marginalised populations.

However, Finn is encountering several challenges:
The classification of online harms is inconsistent, with some forces recording incidents under stalking, others under malicious communications, and some not recording a digital element at all.

It is difficult to trace how these harms are prosecuted, as many do not map clearly onto existing UK criminal offences or are under-recorded due to system limitations.

Data is fragmented across systems and organisations, and there is no standard way to join up or compare records between police and NGO datasets.

Emerging forms of harm (e.g., deepfake abuse, cyberflashing) are not clearly represented in current crime recording systems or taxonomies.

Finn is looking for an ontology of online harms that can help him structure this data in a meaningful way—linking harms to platforms, behaviours, legal categories, and safeguarding responses.

## Competency Questions (CQs)
- How are digital threats (like online harassment, cyberstalking, or image-based abuse) currently detected, recorded, and investigated by UK police forces?
- Do specific personal characteristics (e.g., gender, age, race, disability) influence vulnerability to online harms, and how are these recorded or analysed?
- What tools, features, or digital environments are most commonly exploited by perpetrators in VAWG-related online harms?
- How can an ontology help map online harms to UK legal frameworks (e.g., Malicious Communications Act, Protection from Harassment Act)?
- What kinds of technology or frameworks can be used to support the tracking, investigation, and prosecution of online harms affecting women and girls?
