# Esmeralda
Esmeralda is a software development engineer. She works at a large innovation company, leading the responsible software development unit.


## Goal
Esmeralda wants to produce a guideline of best practices for developing responsible technology (software) in a company specialised in health solutions.


## Scenario
Esmeralda's task is to develop a practical technical guideline aimed at developers and innovators for aligning their solutions to transparency principles and considering the ethical implications of AI. The company develops mainly solutions dedicated to social exchanges.
Esmeralda wants to enhance user experience interacting with new technologies and minimise users exposure to harmful content. Furthermore, the guidelines should include mechanisms for reporting biases or harmful content, for instance, implementing easy-to-access reporting tool to flag content, or features such as ‘why am I seeing this’ to explain factors that led to certain content shown to users. 
On the developers' side, the guidelines should list the socio-technical considerations for avoiding unintended harms and helping identify potential risks when developing new solutions. 


## Competency Questions (CQs)

- How can the software development team assess the risks to online safety associated with their product?
- How do we mitigate harms according to their different definitions?
- What are the best practices/tools/mechanisms used to inhibit online harms against women and girls?
- What are the practices/tools/mechanisms that exacerbate/amplify online harms against women and girls?
- Additionally, depending on the context, what are the specific technology features and usage patterns that enable these harms to arise? Similarly, what are the social and technical mechanisms that can be used to minimise the risk of harms arising?
- What information needs to be logged by the product to meet the investigatory needs of enforcement authorities?
