## Ontology development process

The development followed an iterative process. The first stage involved establishing the overall objective and scope through collaborative discussion with all teams and key stakeholders. The scope and purpose of the ontology were defined collaboratively by stakeholders from the Centre for Protecting Women Online (CPWO). The CPWO brings together experts from [multiple disciplines](https://university.open.ac.uk/centres/protecting-women-online/team), along with local, national, and international partners, including charities, NGOs, and industry organisations.

## Knowledge requirements elicitation

Knowledge requirements were initially gathered through collaboration among five CPWO teams representing the disciplines of law, software development, responsible AI, policing, and human behaviour. Each team created a Persona, a concept adapted from Software Engineering [(Karolita, et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2023.107264), to represent the needs and perspectives of potential ontology users.

Personas created: 6 personas and 6 stories
Location: [personas](personas)
