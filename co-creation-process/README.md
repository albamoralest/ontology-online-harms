## Ontology development process

The development followed an iterative process. The first stage involved establishing the overall objective and scope through collaborative discussion with all teams and key stakeholders. The scope and purpose of the ontology were defined collaboratively by stakeholders from the Centre for Protecting Women Online (CPWO). The CPWO brings together experts from [multiple disciplines](https://university.open.ac.uk/centres/protecting-women-online/team), along with local, national, and international partners, including charities, NGOs, and industry organisations.
